 To deploy a web application on AWS, you can go simple or advanced depending on your requirements. Here's a basic-to-advanced step-by-step guide using the most common services.

üöÄ Basic Deployment (Static or Simple Web App)
Good for: HTML/CSS/JS frontends, simple sites.

Option 1: Deploy static website to S3
Create an S3 Bucket

Enable static website hosting

Upload your HTML/CSS/JS files

Set permissions

Add a bucket policy to allow public access

Access site

Use the S3 static website endpoint

‚úÖ Good for: Static sites, landing pages

üõ†Ô∏è Full Stack Deployment (Dynamic Web App with Backend)
Good for: React/Node/Python/Django apps

Option 2: EC2 (Manual Deployment)
Launch EC2 instance

Choose Amazon Linux or Ubuntu

Open required ports (80, 443, 22)

SSH into the instance


    ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip

Install runtime

Example: Node.js, Python, etc.

Upload your code

Use scp or Git

Run your app

Example: npm start, gunicorn app:app, etc.

Configure a reverse proxy (optional)

Use Nginx or Apache

Point domain (optional)

Route 53 or external DNS

‚úÖ Good for: Custom backend/frontend, more control

‚òÅÔ∏è Scalable Deployment (Modern Approach)
Option 3: Elastic Beanstalk (PaaS)
Package your app

Zip with application.py, requirements.txt, etc.

Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment

Choose platform: Python, Node.js, etc.

Upload and deploy

AWS Console or use EB CLI

‚úÖ Good for: Quick deployments, autoscaling, managed environment

Option 4: Dockerized App on ECS or EKS
Containerize your app

Write a Dockerfile

Push to Amazon ECR

    aws ecr create-repository ...
    docker build -t your-app .
    docker tag your-app:latest <ecr-url>
    docker push <ecr-url>

Deploy on ECS (Fargate) or EKS

Define task definitions, services

Use Load Balancer

‚úÖ Good for: Microservices, scalability, container-first

üß™ Bonus Tools
CI/CD: CodePipeline + CodeDeploy or GitHub Actions

Monitoring: CloudWatch

SSL & DNS: ACM + Route 53
